This repository contains the files in the UCI HAR Dataset; an R script called 'run_analysis.R' that generates a tidy version of the dataset; a codebook explaining how this script works and the tidy version of the dataset that it outputs; and an additional file I created called 'Variable Names.txt' that contains the human-readable versions of the column titles.

There is already a readme file for the dataset itself. this is called 'README.txt'.
